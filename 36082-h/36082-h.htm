<div class="note"><p><i>This article on the china of the administration of President Abraham
Lincoln is intended to be the first of a series of articles on
Presidential china based on the collection in the Smithsonian
Institution. From contemporary records in National Archives, newspaper
articles and family records it is our hope to assemble material which
will ultimately present the story of White House and Presidential
china of every administration. Myths and facts surrounding this
interesting topic will be examined and presented to assist the many
collectors of this porcelain as well as others who admire and
appreciate its historical interest.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">When</span> Mrs. Lincoln arrived at the White House in 1861 she found the pantry
sadly deficient in elegant tableware to set a State dinner. The last
official State service had been purchased by the White House during the
administration of President Franklin Pierce (it is the china known
popularly as the &#8220;red edge&#8221; set), and not enough of that was left to serve
a large dinner party.</p>

<p>Theodore R. Davis, who designed the State china purchased during the
administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes, wrote an article,
published in the May 1899 issue of the <i>Ladies&#8217; Home Journal</i>, on the
&#8220;Presidential Porcelain of a Century.&#8221; He records that in 1860 he saw the
State Dining Room of the White House set up for the formal dinner given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>for the visiting Prince of Wales, and that &#8220;the dishes were more or less
odd, but generally comprised what was known as the &#8216;red edge set&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinaware was not the only thing needed in the Executive Mansion in the
opinion of Mary Todd Lincoln. Fortunately for her, Congress was accustomed
to appropriating $20,000 to refurnish the President&#8217;s House to the taste
of each new First Lady. This money became available to her when the
special session was convened in April 1861, and Mrs. Lincoln set out the
next month on a shopping trip to New York and Philadelphia. She was
accompanied by a favorite cousin, Mrs. Elizabeth Todd Grimsley, who had
come to Washington for the inauguration in March and stayed on at the
White House with the Lincolns for six months.</p>

<p>The ladies&#8217; arrival in New York City on May 12, was duly noted in the city
newspaper. On May 16, 1861, <i>The New York Daily Tribune</i> records under the
heading <i>Personal</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Mrs. Lincoln employed the greater portion of Wednesday forenoon in
making purchases. Among other places she visited the establishments of
Lord &amp; Taylor, and Messrs. E. V. Haughwout and Co. At the latter
establishment she ordered a splendid dinner service for the White
House in &#8220;Solferino&#8221; and gold with the arms of the United States
emblazoned on each piece. The purchases also include some handsome
vases and mantle ornaments for the blue and green rooms.</p>

<p>The firm of E. V. Haughwout and Co. whose bill head identifies it as
&#8220;Importers and Decorators of French China&#8221; was accustomed to Executive
Mansion patronage. Under the name of Haughwout and Dailey they had sold a
dinner service to President Pierce in 1853.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> During Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s May
visit, Haughwout&#8217;s must have shown her a handsome specimen plate they had
exhibited at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York in 1853 which had
been made for President Pierce&#8217;s approval. A picture of the plate in the
Haughwout and Dailey display is shown in the catalog of the Exhibition
where it is identified as &#8220;a specimen plate of a dinner service
manufactured for the President of the United States with the American
eagle and blue band in Alhambra style.&#8221;<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> President Pierce evidently did
not like the design as the service he subsequently purchased from
Haughwout and Dailey had a plain red band and was not the one manufactured
for his approval and exhibited in New York.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary Todd Lincoln was delighted with the plate displayed at the Crystal
Palace Exhibition and ordered a complete dinner service of that design.
Her only change was to have a wide &#8220;Solferino&#8221; border painted on the
service instead of the blue border specified for the 1853 plate. This
bright purplish-red color had become extremely fashionable since its
discovery in 1859, and it provided another variation of Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s
favorite color, which she indulged in personal attire as well as in room
decor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lincoln probably first saw and gave her approval to the elegant new
china when she returned to New York for more shopping in August. The china
was delivered on September 2, 1861, with a bill itemized as follows:<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p>

<p>The picture of the design presented for President Pierce&#8217;s inspection in
1853 which appears in the catalog of the New York Crystal Palace
Exhibition<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> is proof of the readiness with which symbolism is read into
a design which came into existence long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> before the symbol is
appropriate. Writing in 1895 Edwin Atlee Barber says of the Lincoln China
that the design for the decoration, selected after much consultation among
officials at Washington, was added in New York by the importer. It
consisted of a spirited rendering of the arms of the United States&mdash;the
American eagle mounted on the national shield and beneath it the motto <i>E
Pluribus Unum</i>. This design was engraved and then transferred to the china
as an outline to be filled in with color. The border of the plate, a gold
guilloche, or cable, of two strands entwined and, thus, mutually
strengthening each other, was intended to signify the union of the North
and South.<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> The same idea was meant to be conveyed in the central
design: &#8220;Though clouds surround our Country, the sunlight is breaking
through.&#8221; The explanation of the symbolism of the design, while
appropriate for the Lincoln Administration, could hardly have been true
for the china which was originally designed for Presidential use in 1853.</p>

the purple set was ordered. (Smithsonian photo 60001-A.)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradition identifies the blanks on which the design of the Lincoln china
was painted as being imported from the Haviland factory in Limoges,
France. The original china bears no maker&#8217;s mark, however, as this was
more than ten years before the Haviland factory started to mark their
ware.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small> The earliest positive link of the Lincoln china to Haviland and
Company seems to be an affidavit which Theodore R. Davis attached to a
Lincoln plate in 1881 saying &#8220;This plate One of the Lincoln Set made by
Haviland &amp; Co. was used by President Garfield when upon his death bed. The
plate was broken in bringing it from the President&#8217;s room and was given by
Wm. Crump to Theo. R. Davis Sept. 1881.&#8221; The plate is now in the
collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. It is possible
that Theodore Davis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> a personal friend of Theodore Haviland, had derived
directly from Mr. Haviland this manufacturer identification of the china
which Haughwout decorated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The official dinner service so delighted Mrs. Lincoln that she ordered a
similar set for herself. On the personal service the initials &#8220;M. L.&#8221; were
substituted for the arms of the United States as decoration. Mrs. Grimsley
says &#8220;... this latter, I know, was not paid for by the district
commissioner, as was most unkindly charged when it was stored away.&#8221;<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> It
has been suggested that the personal china was paid for by a withdrawal
of $1106.73 from the President&#8217;s account with the bank of Riggs and Co.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The personal china was an indiscreet purchase, at best, and Mrs. Lincoln
was soon accused of buying the china out of public funds. In the midst of
the campaign in which Lincoln ran for re-election in 1864 an opposition
newspaper, <i>The New York World</i>, published a bitter attack on the
President and his wife charging that the bill submitted by Haughwout for
the State service had been padded to include the cost of the personal
china.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small> According to the paper&#8217;s editorial, the deceit was discovered
when the amount of the bill was questioned by a clerk in the Treasury
Department and &#8220;Honest Abe,&#8221; when cornered, made payment out of his own
pocket. This story seems to be refuted by the evidence on the Haughwout
bill, which was signed by the Comptroller for payment on September 16,
1861, within two weeks after the china was received, and only three after
President Lincoln had approved the bill.</p>

<p>The extent to which this controversy spoiled Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s pleasure in
the handsome purple service perhaps can be measured by the fact that after
President Lincoln was re-elected, she purchased another large china
service for the White House. A bill, recently discovered at the National
Archives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> documents the new set as being ordered by Mrs. Lincoln from J.
K. Kerr of 529 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, whose establishment, known
as China Hall, specialized in French and English china and glassware.
Dated January 30, 1865, the bill was for:<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small></p>

<p>Two months later President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. The china so
recently ordered could hardly have been used by Mrs. Lincoln, and
evidently payment had not been made, for it is recorded that at one of the
first conferences which B. B. French, Commissioner of Public Buildings and
Grounds, had with President Johnson in April 1865, he sought the
President&#8217;s approval of payment for a purchase of china by Mrs.
Lincoln.<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small></p>

<p>Despite Commissioner French&#8217;s concern, the account was not completely
settled until a year after the china had been delivered. The first bill is
receipted as paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> on August 29, 1865, at which time it was endorsed
&#8220;Received from B B French C. P. Bgs the above amnt of Two thousand three
hundred &amp; thirty two dollars in full of this account.&#8221; (The difference
between this amount and that given above is accounted for by the fact that
the original order included 4 dozen goblets and 28 dozen wineglasses of
various sizes, costing a total of $632.50.) The second bill was paid on
February 10, 1866.</p>

<p>The inventory made when Mrs. Lincoln turned over the White House to
President Johnson lists under china and glassware &#8220;One full set China,&#8221;
which was certainly this buff and gold service, and &#8220;3 small remnants of
china sets nearly all broken up,&#8221; which must have included the remaining
pieces of the royal-purple service.<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small></p>

<p>Evidently, the Johnsons decided to use the purple china, because we find
that in less than a year they ordered replacement pieces for it. A bill
from E. V. Haughwout, dated January 17, 1866<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small> lists&mdash;</p>

<p>Even with this second order, which almost equalled the original in size
and cost, the purple set did not last; early in the administration of
President Grant not enough of it was left to set the table in the State
Dining Room satisfactorily. Those who handled the Lincoln set grew weary,
it is said, of the constant breakage and became convinced that not
careless handling but &#8220;bad luck in the china itself&#8221; was destroying both
the dishes and the patience of those who were responsible for them.<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small></p>

<p>The story of the china associated with the Lincoln administration must
also include a service used by the Lincolns at the summer White House
which they maintained on the grounds of the Soldiers&#8217; Home in Washington,
D.C. Recently, the Quartermaster Corps of the Army turned over to the
White House for the china collection some pieces of Royal Worcester china
used in the house at the time of President Lincoln&#8217;s occupancy. It has a
wide border of tiny gray and yellow flowers in a diaper design, with a
multicolored floral wreath in the center of the plate. This use of English
china and the informal design of the set is noteworthy, as almost every
set of official china up to this time had been French, and French china
continued to be used at the White House until almost the end of the 19th
century.</p>

<p>It is appropriate in this discussion of the Lincoln china to mention the
number of commemorative reproductions which were made for sale to the
general public as souvenirs in the last quarter of the 19th century. The
earliest of these reproduction pieces seem to be some which are marked on
the back &#8220;Fabriqu&eacute; par Haviland &amp; Co./Pour/J. W. Boteler &amp;
Bro./Washington.&#8221; The firm of J. W. Boteler and Brother is first listed in
the Washington City Directory in 1867 and it was in existence until 1881
when the name of the firm was changed to J. W. Boteler &amp; Son. The dates of
Boteler &amp; Brother encompasses the period of the celebration of the
Centennial of the United States in 1876. This celebration created intense
interest in the Presidency and objects which symbolized the office,
providing a ready market for copies of the Lincoln china. Indeed several
different pieces of White House china have been brought to our attention
with family legends that they were purchased at the &#8220;World&#8217;s Fair.&#8221; In
each case it has been clear that the &#8220;Fair&#8221; meant the Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. Two reproduction plates have been
brought to the Smithsonian Institution for examination. On both of these
the words &#8220;Administration/Abraham Lincoln&#8221; were stamped on the back in
red. It is well for collectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> of White House china to remember that the
original pieces of the Lincoln service did not bear any mark on the
reverse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i021.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<div class="caption"><p class="hang">Figure 12.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Drawing of the mark</span> found, in red, on the two

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The excellent quality of the pieces bearing the Boteler mark may explain a
persistent legend that Edward Lycett was associated with the Lincoln
service.<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small> Mr. Lycett came to this country from England in 1861 and
thereafter was identified with the development and expansion of the art of
china painting in America until the turn of the century. Many sources
credit Mr. Lycett with painting the second order of the Lincoln service on
commission of John Vogt &amp; Co. of New York City. As the records establish
the fact that the second order for the china was made to E. V. Haughwout &amp;
Co., just as was the first, we can only speculate that perhaps Mr. Lycett
painted the commemorative china which bears the mark of J. W. Boteler &amp;
Brother and of Haviland &amp; Co. which is so beautifully hand painted to
match the official White House china.</p>

14, 1865, just before he attended the performance at Ford&#8217;s Theater at
which he was assassinated.</p></div>

our name if: 1st our china was better than any one else or at least as
good and 2nd if we made enough for our trade. Without that it would turn
against us and learn people that by ordering through Vogt or Nittal they
could get Gibus or Julieus china which is better than ours. And if ours
was the best but we did not make enough to fill orders there would be a
complaint when we gave other manufacturer&#8217;s china. So our first aim must

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
